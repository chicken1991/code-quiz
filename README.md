## Joining javascript and html

This quiz displays multiple choise questions for the user to answer. Once a user clicks start, a timer counts down. Once the timer hits zero, or if all questions are answered, the game is over. A score is then displayed, and the user can input their name to store the score to local storage for the next visit.
